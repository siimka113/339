                    <p>A 7-week art direction and interaction design project for Dutch Design Week using insights from
                        various precedent designers to guide the process. The final microsite promotes select
                        exhibitions using a refined content strategy and user flow, tied together by highly-refined
                        visual design and interactions.

                        <br><br>This project is for a design class, IAT 235, and is not affiliated with Dutch Design
                        Week.

                        locations within Eindhoven, Netherlands.

                        <br>Our exhibit selections are tied together by the common theme of confronting the future,

                    <p>A hover to reveal image interaction that engages the visitor right away, giving them a sense of

                <div class="text-left">
                    <p>I designed an automatic scroll interaction on the exhibition explore page, which ensures a
                        preview of each exhibition is presented to the visitor, even if they are not actively scrolling
                        through them. </p>

                    <p>I created thought-provoking questions that introduce and frame each exhibit within a visitor’s
                        life experience. This creates a personal connection between the visitor and the content, making
                        them more likely to visit the exhibit. </p>

                <div class="text-right">
                    <p>At the bottom of each exhibit, a preview of the next one slides onto screen, coming into focus
                        and scaling to frame. When clicked, the page transitions seamlessly to the next exhibition
                        within the narrative. </p>

            <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
            <h3>“Don’t design in your head.” - Advice I heard repeatedly during the project, though I only recognized
                its importance in retrospect. </h3>
            <p>I learned the importance of having concrete design “evidence” to back up every decision, from high-level
                user flows to low-level visual design and interactive details. My approach to design changed
                significantly after completing this project, as I started thinking more intentionally about everything I
                presented to my teams, teaching staff, and stakeholders. <br>
                If I had more time, I would go back and refine the user flow to have a more flexible navigation system
                (instead of being purely linear), and experiment more with engaging or immersive interactions. </p>
