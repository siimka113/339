                    <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
                    <h3>“Don’t design in your head.” - Advice I heard repeatedly during the project, though I only recognized its importance in retrospect.  </h3>
                    <p>I learned the importance of having concrete design “evidence” to back up every decision, from high-level user flows to low-level visual design and interactive details. My approach to design changed significantly after completing this project, as I started thinking more intentionally about everything I presented to my teams, teaching staff, and stakeholders. <br>
                        If I had more time, I would go back and refine the user flow to have a more flexible navigation system (instead of being purely linear), and experiment more with engaging or immersive interactions. </p>
