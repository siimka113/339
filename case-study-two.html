                        <p>The SFU Blueprint website serves as an access point for student club involvement, non-profits, and potential sponsors. My role was to design a responsive website that meets accessibility standards, while also incorporating unique branding and art direction. 

                            <br><br>I became involved with SFU Blueprint in September 2023, and have been designing the club's website until recently, in collaboration with developers. The site's development is currently ongoing! </p>

Furthermore, visual elements were optimized for mobile viewing, ensuring clear and engaging presentation even on smaller screens. </p>

                    <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
                    <h3>Designing for the web means letting go of pixel-perfect perfection, instead prioritizing responsiveness and accessibility.  </h3>
                    <p>Creating responsive layouts was more time-consuming than I anticipated. I discovered that the main task of web designers is not to achieve perfection like in print design, but to ensure that the content templates are as flexible as possible. This is a skill I'm still learning. However, this project was a valuable first step towards mastering it.</p>
